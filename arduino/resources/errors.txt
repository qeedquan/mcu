***Wiring for push button state

If you hook up a wire into a push button and then into a digital/analog
pin for measuring the state of the button, you need to make sure that
the wire is on the same strip as the button, or else if you make it
connected indirectly via a resistor on that strip and then the wire on another strip
connected to the push button it will read the state correctly (pulled down by resistor)

***Push button on 5V and GND
If you wire 5V and GND to a push button and try to use that button, that button will
act as a circuit breaker in the connection and can cause the Arduino to reset itself.
