***Piezo Resistor Ladder
To save on digital pins, one common trick is to use a resistor ladder, which
is a cascade of different resistance ladder connected in parallel hooked
to a set of buttons. When the buttons close the circuit, it will close
a resistor and an analog read will return a range that we can use to
distinguish states.

We hook up 220 ohm, 10 kohm, 1 mohm in parallel with a 10 kohm in series
The following shows the analog values read back

Analog read states:
Floating (No buttons closed) ~0
First button closed ~1023 (10 kohm)
Second button closed ~990:~1000 (220 ohm + 10 kohm)
Third button closed: ~500:~600 (10 kohm + 10kohm)
Fourth button closed ~10:~20 (1 mohm + 10 kohm)

Use these analog values to feed into the piezo at different tones,
while the button is closed, it will keep generating the tone at that
frequency, when we release it, the duration will expire and silence occurs
