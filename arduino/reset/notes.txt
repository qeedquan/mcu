***Button Reset
The Arduino does a reset when the reset pin is pulled low, so we can
wire it to a push button to control it externally.

Use 10k resistance, the higher the value less power is wasted.
Rule of thumb is 10k is adequate to protect against noise on board.

For long term durability of switches, a resistor helps prevention of
corrosion build-up.
