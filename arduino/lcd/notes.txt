***LCD Crystal Ball
A tilt sensor is hooked up to a digital read, it will change state
when it is shaken, emulating an eight-ball. Then using an LCD, we generate
a random reply and display that.

***Pitfalls
The LCD has alot of input pins, make sure they are all wired right.
If the potentiometer/resistor is not wired to 3 correctly, or if there
is no resistor at all, the text will not display.
