*** Sypnosis
The PPCE500 is a emulation of the PPC e500 series (e500v2/e500mc/e5500/e6500).
The platform is based on the SOC MPC85xx series, but since MPC85xx share alot of the same registers as the (P4080, P5020, T2080),
we can use some kernel builts for those and boot it.

*** Boot
If -bios is passed, then QEMU will use pc-bios/u-boot.e500 as u-boot firmware to load
If -kernel is passed, then QEMU will just load the image directly as a kernel with all the setup done for us behind the scenes.

Upon initial loading of the kernel image, QEMU will follow the standard PowerPC boot specified by the Power_ePAPR document.
The ePAPR document specifies what the device tree format will look like and what initial CPU state the system will have.

*** Interrupts

The Open PIC controller is used as an interrupt controller.
PowerPC by default has a fixed exception vector table (usually at 0 or 0xffff0000) that contains an external interrupt exception.
What external interrupts get triggered is configured by the Open PIC interrupt controller.
